The election result data that is analyzed has 3 fields: ballot ID, the county of the voter, and the candidate for which the vote was cast. The purpose of this analysis is to determine the winning candidate of the election with exact vote counts and percentages of their vote with respect to the total vote; the exact vote counts of the counties and their respective percentages of the total vote will be used to determine the county which had the highest amount of votes.
